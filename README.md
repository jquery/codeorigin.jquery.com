=====================

## Add new assets

To publish a new release, project maintainers should commit new assets to the `cdn/` directory and push to the `main` branch. The jQuery CDN (code.jquery.com) and releases site (releases.jquery.com) will both automatically rebuild.

## WordPress build

This repository is also used to update the asset catalog at <https://releases.jquery.com/>, which is an auto-generated WordPress site.

To preview changes for a [`jquery-wp-content`](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content) instance, follow the [workflow instructions](https://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/#workflow) from our documentation on [contributing to jQuery Foundation web sites](https://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/).

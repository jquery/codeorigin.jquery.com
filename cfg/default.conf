#
# This file is responsible for the site which serves the main releases from codeorigin. By default,
# it generates a site that operates in "break glass" emergency mode. All requests are served,
# regardless of where they come from.
#
# In production, the CDN should add a private header to origin fetches. All requests which do not
# include the correct header should be bounced via 301 redirect back to the CDN. This ensures that
# even if a client attempts to link to codeorigin, it will still be served from the CDN. The end
# result should be that codeorigin is only reachable for origin pulls from the CDN, decreasing its
# load and reducing the attack surface for DDOSs.
#
# Configuration information is in the README.md file.

  # Jenkins artefacts were pushed to an isolated area mounted as "/git/"
  # on the codeorigin server. The contents were only accessible via a
  # plethora of rewrites rules that made these files blend in among
  # CDN assets from a URL prespective. For example:
  #
  # - "/ui/foo-1.2.3.js" would be served from "/cdn/ui/foo-1.2.3.js"
  # - "/ui/foo-git.js" would be served from "/git/ui/foo-git.js".

  # This must "win" over the "-git" location match as otherwise

  #
  # Achieved by using the `^~` operator instead of a simple prefix match,
